# My solution - Too Slow

SELECT id as Id
FROM Weather w
WHERE w.temperature > (
  SELECT temperature
  FROM Weather w2
  WHERE recordDate = DATE_SUB(w.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
);

## DATE_SUB function from MYSQL to subtract one date from the recordDate
## and select the yesterday to compare the recordDate

# Other solution

SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1, Weather w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1 AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature;

## DATEDIFF function to get dates where the difference is 1
